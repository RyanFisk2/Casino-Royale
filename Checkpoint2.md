# Casino Royale

## Deviations from Work Distribution and timelime
We've been able to maintain mostly the same timeline and work distribution from our original plan, however we only<br/>
have the one Pi, so more of the hardware work has fallen on Niko since he has the device. The other part of our plan<br/>
that we need to figure out is the setup of the Pi for the final demo. Initially we were thinking about having a plexiglass <br/>
table that the Pi could look up through to scan the cards, but we may have to change this.

We should also be able to maintain the same timeline from our original plan.

## Where we fell behind
We haven't been able to work on setting up the Pi so that it's not handheld. Ideally we'd build a table with a <br/>
clear top so that the Pi could scan all of the cards from below, but we'll have to discuss this further since we <br/>
would have to meet in person to have the Pi and table together.


## How we plan to catch up
We've been able to communicate pretty effectively using groupme and text, so integrating all of the parts of the project<br/>
shouldn't be too difficult. If possible Niko and I could meet up to integrate the Pi itself with the table.
